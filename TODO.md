# TODO
- [ ] Combine arguments parser and help generator. The following syntax: `/command --help` should be equivalent to `/help -c command`. So this will be `flag` package adapted for bots.
- [ ] Add `open weather map` support to `Weather` module.
- [ ] Add `/wttr_location` and `/owm_location` to `Weather`. This commands should save default locations for user.
